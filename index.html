                <h1>About Us</h1>

                <p>Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999, highlighting stories of coffee from
                    around
                    the world. We have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to brew - in every
                    shipment.</p>

                <h1>Our commitment</h1>
                <p>We're built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make it easy
                    for
                    you to discover and brew the world's best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate the
                    specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the
                    challenges
                    and initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each
                    lot
                    to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>

            <h1 class="text">Uncompromising quality</h1>

            <p class="text">Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing, we employ,
                on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every
                bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent,
                user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
